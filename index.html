        <h3>Profile</h3>
			<p>Hi! I'm an interaction designer based in Vancouver who enjoys delivering information with visual strategies through digital experiences and interfaces. I see design with a multidisciplinary approach that allows ideas to emerge from the intersection of user behaviour, products and spaces within systems on a holistic level.
